|Version| |Python Version| |Build Status| |Coverage Status|

Pyexperiment facilitates the development of small, reproducible
experiments with minimal boilerplate code. Consider the following
example, implementing a simple program complete with a comprehensive
command line interface, help, logging, timing, and a user-defined
message configurable by configuration file or command line parameter.


.. code-block:: python

   from pyexperiment import experiment, state, conf, log
   
   conf['pyexperiment.save_state'] = True
   conf['pyexperiment.load_state'] = True
   conf['message'] = "The stored numbers are: "
   
   
   def store(number):
       """Store a number"""
       if 'numbers' not in state:
           log.debug("Initialize state['numbers'] to empty list")
           state['numbers'] = []
   
       log.debug("Store number: %s", number)
       state['numbers'].append(float(number))
   
   
   def show():
       """Show the stored numbers and compute their sum"""
       print(conf['message'] + str(state['numbers']))
       with log.timed("sum"):
           total = sum(state['numbers'])
       print("The total is: " + str(total))
   
   
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       experiment.main(commands=[store, show])


Motivation
----------

There is no shortage of great Python libraries for command line
interfaces, logging, configuration file management, persistent state, or
plotting. When writing small scripts for quick experiments though, it's
often too much effort to configure these components, and one ends up
rewriting the same setup code over and over again.

Pyexperiment fixes this by providing a simple way to jump start a
short experiment. Importing pyexperiment will give you:

-  A basic *command line interface* that allows calling arbitrary
   functions (and passing arguments) from the command prompt,
   providing help text derived from the functions' docstrings and
   zsh/bash autocompletion (based on the standard library's argparse
   and argcomplete).
-  A simple *configuration management* with an easy way to provide
   default values (based on the excellent configobj library).
-  A thread-safe *logger* with configurable logging levels, *timing
   utilities* with statistics, and rotating log files (based on the
   standard library's logging module).
-  *Persistent state* with platform independent, configurable,
   (optionally rotating) state files that are compatible with many other
   programs (based on h5py).
-  A sensible setup for *plotting* (based on matplotlib, and optionally
   seaborn), with configurable defaults and asynchronous plotting.
-  Many other bits and pieces that might come in handy...

As a design principle, pyexperiment's components come ready to use
without any further configuration. Inevitably then, the choices made in
this setup are opinionated and may or may not fit your personal taste.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install pyexperiment is from pypi, just call ``pip install
--user pyexperiment`` (alternatively, use ``pip install pyexperiment`` in a
virtualenv, or prepend `sudo` for system wide installation).

The pyexperiment package has a few external dependencies (as you can
see in the `requirements.txt
<https://github.com/duerrp/pyexperiment/blob/master/docker/requirements.txt>`__):

-  six
-  configobj
-  numpy
-  h5py
-  matplotlib
-  lockfile
-  toolz
-  IPython (optional, adds --interactive command)
-  argcomplete (optional, adds activate_autocompletion command)
-  seaborn (optional, adds more plotting options)
   
If you install (the h5py dependency) from pypi, you may need to install
libhdf5 first, e.g., by running ``sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev``.
You may also find that you need to install cython first, e.g., by
running either ``sudo apt-get install Cython`` or ``pip install
Cython``.

Reproducible experiments
------------------------

To keep your experiments reproducible and avoid dependency problems, it
is a good idea to automate the setup of your development environment,
e.g., using a Vagrant box, or - in many cases even better - a Docker
image. To get started with pyexperiment using Vagrant or Docker, you can
use the Vagrantfile and setup script
`here <https://github.com/duerrp/pyexperiment/blob/master/vagrant>`__,
or the Dockerfile and setup scripts
`here <https://github.com/duerrp/pyexperiment/blob/master/docker>`__.
