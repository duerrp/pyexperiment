"""Provides a multiprocessing-safe way to aggregate results from
multiple function calls.

In multi-process programs, it is oft often useful to delegate a
function call - e.g., writing a log message to a file - to another
process to avoid conflicts. :class:`pyexperiment.utils.DelegateCall`
implements a functor that, when called, passes the argument data to a
function running in a thread of the process that created the
DelegateCall object. The callback itself must be thread-safe though.
