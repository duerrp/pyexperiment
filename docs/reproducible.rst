Reproducible experiments
------------------------

To keep your experiments reproducible and avoid dependency problems, it
is a good idea to automate the setup of your development environment,
e.g., using a Vagrant box, or - in many cases even better - a Docker
image. To get started with pyexperiment using Vagrant or Docker, you can
use the Vagrantfile and setup script
`here <https://github.com/duerrp/pyexperiment/blob/master/vagrant>`__,
or the Dockerfile and setup scripts
`here <https://github.com/duerrp/pyexperiment/blob/master/docker>`__.
