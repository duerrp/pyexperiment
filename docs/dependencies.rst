Dependencies
------------

The pyexperiment package has a few external dependencies (as you can see
in the
`requirements.txt <https://github.com/duerrp/pyexperiment/blob/master/requirements.txt>`__):

-  six
-  configobj
-  numpy
-  h5py
-  matplotlib

If you install the dependencies from pypi, you may need to install
libhdf5 first, e.g., by running ``sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev``.
