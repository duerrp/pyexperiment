[![Development Status](https://pypip.in/status/pyexperiment/badge.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyexperiment/)

When writing small python scripts for quick experiments, it's often
too much effort to add a good command line argument parser, a
configuration system or a logger.

Pyexperiment fixes this by providing a very simple way to setup a
short experiment, adding many features of a full-blown framework.

Check the example file to see how you can use pyexperiment for your
own experiments.

Dependencies
============

The pyexperiment package has a few external dependencies:

* configobj >= 5.0.5
* numpy >= 1.8.1
* h5py >= 2.3.1

If you install the dependencies with pip, you may need to install
libhdf5 first, e.g., by running `sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev`.
